The code implements mechanisms to collect data from various sensors placed in and around the urban lake. The sensors gather important water parameters such as temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient levels, among other things. Data collection is designed to be continuous and remote, providing a high-frequency dataset for analysis.The heart of the code involves implementing the CRISP-DM model (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining). This involves creating a predictive model that can analyze the collected sensor data, identifying trends and patterns. The code employs machine learning algorithms that can predict critical water parameters based on the collected sensor data.
Key functionality: One of the key functionalities of the code is to forecast water temperature based on past trends and current conditions. Temperature plays a crucial role in the well-being of aquatic life, and any abrupt changes can result in severe damage, such as fish death.
